Hi there! 

This project was created keeping in mind the creativity and fun while intsead of making a boring dashboard.

Although the project is not complete I have created a drag and drop dashboard where the admin may drag the users from the left hand side of the panel and drop them onto the drop area on the right

MISSING FUNCTIONS:

Due to some personal reasons i was unable to create a few important functionalities, but i aim to work on that in the future if given an opportunity:

1) Not suitable for mobile yet
2) As requested the add, edit, or delete is not yet available but I can follow up in the future

FUTURE CHANGES:

I am to be able to convert this dashboard into a tabular view for further efficiency, also I would love to show a seperate area for all tasks completed and remaining for a certain user.


HOW TO START:

terminal commands: 

Firstly please run this command (assuming this is a react project):
npm install react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend

then please run:

npm start
